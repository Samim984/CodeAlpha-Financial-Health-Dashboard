## 🎯 Key Insights  

- Revenue peaked in 2023 but declined sharply in 2024 (–39% YoY).  
- COGS (81%) and rising operating expenses limited profit margins below 12%.  
- Equity dropped 41% while liabilities grew faster, raising long-term risk.  
- Net Cash Flow declined 40% YoY due to heavy investing outflows.  
- Actual Sales & Profit consistently missed budget by –9% to –18% across years.  
- Forecasts for 2025–26 indicate modest recovery but below planned growth.
